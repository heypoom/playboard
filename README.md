# Playboard: Interactive Live Game for Dev Meetups and Hackathons

Hey! This is Playboard, an interactive and real-time game app for use in dev meetups and hackathons to spice things up.

This is my first project to learn with Phoenix and Elixir, so don't expect much :)

## Developing with Phoenix

To start your Phoenix server:

- Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install` inside the `assets` directory
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/deployment.html).
